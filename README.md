# Interactive Community Search Framework (GICS)

This repository contains the code, datasets, and sample queries of the paper **"A Flexible Framework for Query-oriented Interactive Community Search"**, which is submitted to PVLDB'25.

The GICS framework contains three key components: *personalized adding/deleting recommendation*, *parameter auto-tuning*, and *fast partial refinement*. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we implement the GICS framework on three representative community search models, including **[ACQ](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol9/p1233-fang.pdf)**, **[WCS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9272333)** and **[ICSGNN](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p1006-gao.pdf)**. 

The instructions for running the code on three models are in three folders (ACQ, WCS, ICSGNN) separately.
